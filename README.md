# basicImgClassifier
THis is a basic Machine learning project in this project i implemented the CNN concept to enable my model
to learn how to classify clothes images that i previously retrieved from the Fashion MNIST database.


**Disclaimer:
**
for using on different databases you will need to change some things e.g.  Data Loading & Preprocessing, CNN input shape
in order to match the raw data you have in your DB
